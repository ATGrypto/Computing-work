Once upon a time there was a boy named Jaysee. He found an apple and took it home.
But his brother Scot wanted it as well. So they had a big fight resulting in both getting sent to the hospital and the house being damaged. 
In the end, the apple rolled out of the window and was eaten by a random passer by.
When the two were discharged, they went to the passer by and attempted to beat him up. But the passer by, Wei Yi, threw his phone at jaysee.
The phone hit jaysee and jaysee fell on Scot.
They were sent to the hospital once again. When they were discharged, they went to the passer by again, this time armed with frying pans.
But Wei Yi also had tricks up his sleeve. He had took his 20 dogs along with him.
In the end, both jaysee and Scot wear almost eaten by the dogs. They were sent to the hospital again.
This time, they told the doctor"Please help me get better so I can get revenge." The doctor turned around  to reveal a familiar face. 
It was Wei Yi.
Jaysee was shocked and confused. But before he knew it, Wei Yi threw a piece of banana skin onto Jaysee and ran away.
Jaysee and Scot finally gave up on getting revenge.
Then end

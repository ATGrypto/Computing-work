Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Jaysee. He found an apple on the floor and took it home to eat. <br>

However, his brother Scott spotted the apple. Hence, he wanted to eat it as well. However, Jaysee was unwilling to give the apple to Scott. As a result, they had a big fight, resulting in both of them being injured seriously and they got sent to the hospital. Furthermore, their house was also damaged. <br>

Despite all of the efforts each brother took to secure the apple, the apple rolled out of their window while they were still in the hospital. A passer-by spotted the apple and ate it. <br>

When Jaysee and Scott were discharged from the hospital, they realised that their apple was gone. After a bout of painstaking searching and evidence analysing, they finally tracked down the passer-by’s location. The two decided to ambush the passer-by. <br>

However, just as they were about to attack, the passer-by, Weiyi, threw his phone at Jaysee in self-defence. <br>

The phone hit Jaysee and he lost his balance. Unfortunately, Jaysee fell onto and crushed Scott. <br>

Feeling pity for them, Weiyi picked up his phone (which was surprisingly in good condition) and dialled 995, sending an ambulance for the two unconscious boys.  <br>

After Jaysee and Scott were discharged for the second time, they set on to attack Weiyi again. They armed themselves with frying pans and kitchen knives, ready for a fight. <br>

Eventually, the two boys found Weiyi’s home. Without hesitation, they broke down Weiyi’s front door, eager to teach him a lesson. However, what the two boys didn’t know was that Weiyi owned 20 guard dogs in his house. Alerted by the intruders’ movements, the guard dogs attacked and ferociously bit them in rapid succession. Yet again, the two boys were sent back to the hospital. <br>

This time, Jaysee and Scott turned to the doctor and said to him, “Please help us get stronger and healthier so that I can get revenge on the passer-by who ate our apple.” Upon hearing their request, the doctor turned around to reveal a familiar face. <br>

It was Weiyi. <br>

The two boys were stunned. Before they knew it, Weiyi pulled out a banana, gulped it down in one bite, and threw the banana skin onto Jaysee. <br>

stupefied by Weiyi’s insane strategies and intelligence, the boys had no time to react before Weiyi ran away hurriedly. <br>

Fuming with anger, Jaysee and Scott pledged to successfully launch an attack on Weiyi and steal his money in order to buy more apples for their consumption. Thus, they began to search for him. <br>

Unbeknownst to them, Weiyi had actually left the country’s and immigrated to Switzerland, where he lived peacefully. Jaysee and Scott didn’t know this, and searched the entire island to no avail. Exasperated and exhausted, they decided to relax and forget about Weiyi. <br>

A year passed. Jaysee and Scott were in their homes, relaxing. Weiyi had not been seen and they had forgotten about the whole ordeal. <br>

Suddenly, Weiyi barged into the boys’ house and threw 50 apples at them. They tried to hide in their cardboard but the flimsy material was no much for the solid red apples thrown using Weiyi’s muscular arms. <br>

Jaysee was angry at Weiyi for popping in unexpectedly, and he confronted him with his slipper. However, Scott was hiding in their toilet, afraid to come out lest he gets injured and sent to the hospital again. Disappointed and infuriated at Scott’s cowardly mannerisms, Jaysee stormed over and busted down the cubicle door that Scott was in. <br>

In a fit of panic and shock, Scott grabbed hold of Jaysee by his neck and slammed him down into the toilet bowl, and flushed him down. Unexpectedly, Jaysee landed into Weiyi’s secret underground lab. <br>

At this moment, Weiyi walked in, dragging an unconscious Scott that he had apprehended after sneaking on him after Jaysee was flushed. The two were now unfortunate test subjects for Weiyi’s experiments. <br>

After browsing through YouTube, Weiyi stumbled upon an instructional HowToBasic video. Inspired by the video, Weiyi put his idea into reality. <br>

After meddling with some code and hardware, Weiyi successfully programmed an egg launcher that fired 200 eggs every minute. Aiming it at Jaysee, Weiyi pulled the trigger. <br>

To Weiyi’s dismay, Jaysee’s protective fat caused all of the eggs to bounce off him. Scott, however, was not as lucky as him. All of the eggs that were bounced off Jaysee landed onto Scott. As a result, he was obliterated by the rotten eggs, <br>

But Scott has his tactics too… <br>

Scott used his ultimate skill and let out a muffled autistic screech. By causing a magnitude 50 earthquake by using sound alone, Weiyi was deafened for a good 20 minutes. <br>

Using the opportunity to escape, the two boys rushed back to their home, finally glad that they were free from Weiyi’s laboratory. <br>

Unfortunately for them, Weiyi had set up hidden spy cameras all over their house when they were admitted to the hospital. This way, Weiyi could track every single movement that the two boys made. <br>

Weiyi showed up at the boys’ house at 4am in the morning, and sneaked into sSott’s room. After carefully analysing every frame of the Among Us Impostor kill animations, Weiyi shot Scott. <br>

However, Jaysee had heard the commotion going in Scott’s room. By using the SGSecure app, Jaysee took a picture of Weiyi murdering Scott and reported to the police. <br>

After Jaysee sent the photo, a mysterious portal opened, and PewDiePie appeared. seeing that Scott was lying on the floor, PewDiePie approved him of supporting Floor Gang, and he revived Scott. However, Weiyi was banned from r/PewdiepieSubmissions for 90 days. <br>

screaming in shock, Weiyi ran back to his secret lab. Thankfully, Jaysee and Scott were free from Weiyi, and they were safe. For now...

The next day, Weiyi got his troop of apes armed with banana launchers and started to attack Scott and Jaysee. they were caught off guard and started screaming hysterically, Scott even threw his slipper at Weiyi to warn him to retreat. However, his slippers was too weak to make Weiyi to retreat and Jaysee and Scott ran away. They were really pissed asf and wanted to get revenge on Weiyi but they could not think of any good solutions.  Weiyi was still chasing them, Scott and Jaysee could not outrun him. Suddenly they founded a abandoned toilet bowl and threw it at Weiyi.

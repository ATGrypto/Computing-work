Once upon a time there was a boy named Jaysee. He found an apple on the floor and took it home to eat.
But his brother Scott wanted it as well. So they had a big fight resulting in both getting sent to the hospital and the house being damaged. 
In the end, the apple rolled out of the window and was eaten by a random passer-by. 
When the two were discharged, they went to the passer-by and attempted to beat him up. But the passer-by, Weiyi, threw his phone at Jaysee. 
The phone hit Jaysee and Jaysee fell onto Scott, sending them both tumbling onto the ground and both of them sustaining serious injuries yet again. 
weiyi picked up his phone and called the police, sending the two boys to the hospital. 
When they were discharged, they found the passer-by again, this time armed with frying pans and and knifes. 
But Weiyi also had some tricks up his sleeve. What Jaysee and Scott did not know was that Weiyi had 20 dogs in his home. Grinning, he unleashed his dogs on the 2 boys. 
In the end, both Jaysee and Scott were almost eaten alive by Weiyi's dogs. They were sent to the hospital once again with bleeding wounds. 
This time, they told the doctor, "Please help me get stronger and healthier so that I can get revenge on the passer-by who ate our apple." The doctor turned around to reveal a familiar face. 
It was Weiyi. 
Jaysee was shocked and confused. But before he knew it, Weiyi plucked a banana and threw the piece of his banana skin onto Jaysee and ran away hurriedly. 
Stupefied by Weiyi's strategies and intelligence, Jaysee and Scott finally gave up on getting revenge and went back to their broken house. 
They then got angry over the apple again and started fighting once more. 
They truced and tried to attack weiyi and steal his money to buy more apples for them.

but weiyi was nowhere to be found. 
scott and jaysee were really angry
Suddenly, Weiyi came back with fifty apples and started throwing at Scott and Jaysee. They tried to hide in their carboard bunker but was totally destroyed by the projectiles Weiyi launched. Jaysee was angry at Weiyi's attack and confronted him with his slipper. Scott was hiding inside a cubicle as he was to scared to follow Jaysee and confront Weiyi. Jaysee was really angry and went to the toilet and busted the cubicle door Scott was in. 
Scott stuffed Jaysee into the toilet bowl and flushed him down. Jaysee then came out in an underground secret lab that belongs to wei yi.
The secret lab was made by weiyi and his wife, _____ (insert any 1D boys' name)
Just at this moment, Wei yi walked in, holding scott by his neck using his muscular hands. 
The two were then imprisoned in Wei Yi's lab to use as test subjects. Wei Yi then searched up a howtobasic video and got an idea.
He programmed an egg launcher that fires 200 eggs per minute and aimed it at jaysee.
But to Wei Yi's dismay, All the eggs bounced off jaysee. However, Scot did not have such defense. He was absolutely destroyed by the rotten eggs.
But Scott also has his tactics...
Scott used his ultimate skill and let out a muffled bloodcurdling screech, so powerful that it blinded and deafended Wei Yi for 30 minutes.
The 2 then escaped and returned to what they call their house.
They were safe.
For now...

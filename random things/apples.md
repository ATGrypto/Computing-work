Once upon a time there was a boy named Jaysee. He found an apple and took it home. <br>
But his brother Scott wanted it as well. So they had a big fight resulting in both getting sent to the hospital and the house being damaged. <br>
In the end, the apple rolled out of the window and was eaten by a random passer-by. <br>
When the two were discharged, they went to the passer-by and attempted to beat him up. But the passer-by, Weiyi, threw his phone at Jaysee. <br>
The phone hit Jaysee and Jaysee fell onto Scott, sending them both tumbling onto the ground and both of them sustained serious injuries yet again. <br>
They were sent to the hospital once again. When they were discharged, they found the passer-by again, this time armed with frying pans. <br>
But Weiyi also had some tricks up his sleeve. What Jaysee and Scott did not know was that Weiyi had 20 dogs in his home. Grinning, he unleashed his dogs on the 2 boys. <br>
In the end, both Jaysee and Scott were almost eaten alive by Weiyi's dogs. They were sent to the hospital once again. <br>
This time, they told the doctor, "Please help me get stronger and healthier so that I can get revenge on the passer-by who ate our apple." The doctor turned around to reveal a familiar face. <br>
It was Weiyi. <br>
Jaysee was shocked and confused. But before he knew it, Weiyi pulled out a banana and threw the piece of his banana skin onto Jaysee and ran away hurriedly. <br>
Stupefied by Weiyi's strategies and intelligence, Jaysee and Scott finally gave up on getting revenge. <br>

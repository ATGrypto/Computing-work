Once upon a time there was a boy named Jaysee. He found an apple on the floor and took it home to eat. <br>

However, his brother Scott saw the apple that Jaysee had obtained and he was hungry. Therefore, he wanted the apple as well. As a result, they had a long quarrel resulting in both physically attacking each other, which further resulted into them being so injured that they got sent to the hospital. Moreover, the house even got damaged. <br>

Despite all of their efforts to obtain the apple, it rolled out of the window and was spotted by a random passer-by. The passer-by was hungry too, and decided to consume the apple without any hesitation. <br>

When the two were discharged, they realised that the apple was gone. They tracked down the passer-by who had eaten their apple using the security cameras that were set up around the neighbourhood. Upon locating the passer-by, the two boys attempted to ambush him. However, the passer-by, Weiyi, threw his phone at Jaysee before he had a chance to attack him. <br>

The phone hit Jaysee and Jaysee fell onto Scott, sending them both tumbling onto the ground and both of them sustaining serious injuries yet again. They lost consciousness shortly after. <br>

Upon seeing the poor state that the two boys were in, Weiyi decided to have some empathy. Thus, he picked up his phone (which was magically still working) and dialed 995, sending the two boys to the hospital. <br>

When they were discharged, they found the passer-by again, this time armed with frying pans and and knifes. <br>

But Weiyi also had some tricks up his sleeve. What Jaysee and Scott did not know was that Weiyi had 20 dogs in his home. Grinning, he unleashed his dogs on the 2 boys. <br>

In the end, both Jaysee and Scott were almost eaten alive by Weiyi's dogs. They were sent to the hospital once again with large cuts and scratches, red blood still oozing freely from them. <br>

This time, they told the doctor, "Please help me get stronger and healthier so that I can get revenge on the passer-by who ate our apple." The doctor turned around to reveal a familiar face. <br>

It was Weiyi. <br>

Jaysee was shocked and confused. But before he knew it, Weiyi plucked a banana and threw the piece of his banana skin onto Jaysee and ran away hurriedly. <br>

Stupefied by Weiyi's strategies and intelligence, Jaysee and Scott finally gave up on getting revenge and went back to their broken house. <br>

However, Jaysee and Scott's stubbornness led them to decide to change their minds, and foolishly decided to attempt to ambush Weiyi and get revenge on him by stealing his money in order to buy more apples for their own delight and well-earned consumption. What they didn't know was that Weiyi had actually left the country and migrated to Switzerland, where he lived in peace, far away from Jaysee and Scott. Without knowing this information, Jaysee and Scott searched the humble island of Singapore for Weiyi, but he was nowhere to be nowhere. Exasperated and angry, they decided to give up, and drop this apple conflict once and for all. <br>

The end.
